# React TypeScript Webpack Template

Welcome to the React TypeScript Webpack Template This project serves as a foundational structure for building React applications using TypeScript, Webpack, and other modern tooling. It's designed to streamline the development process, ensuring best practices are followed right from the start.

## Project Overview

This template includes:

- **React**: The core library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Webpack**: A powerful module bundler that simplifies the management of assets in your project.
- **ESLint**: Lints your code to ensure it adheres to best practices and maintains high code quality.
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting across your entire project.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Version 12 or later is recommended.
- Familiarity with basic Git commands is helpful but not required.
